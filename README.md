# WeightedLocalMagnitudePatterns
WeightedLocalMagnitudePatterns for recoginition of (morphed images || faceswapped images)

In this project I developed a working code based on IEEE paper which is on Digital Face Presentation Attack Detection via Weighted Local Magnitude Patterns.Developed a model using SVM which gives me a accuracy of about 93 % .
